<p>Ensures that all the density folders are present</p>

<p>Icons will look best if a custom version is provided for each of the major screen density classes (low, medium, high, extra high). This lint check identifies folders which are missing, such as <code>drawable-hdpi</code>.<br/>
Low density is not really used much anymore, so this check ignores the ldpi density. To force lint to include it, set the environment variable <code>ANDROID_LINT_INCLUDE_LDPI=true</code>. For more information on current density usage, see <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/screens.html">http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/screens.html</a></p>
