<p>Looks for straight quotes which can be replaced by curvy quotes</p>

<p>Straight single quotes and double quotes, when used as a pair, can be replaced by "curvy quotes" (or directional quotes). This can make the text more readable.<br/>
<br/>
Note that you should never use grave accents and apostrophes to quote, `like this'.<br/>
<br/>
(Also note that you should not use curvy quotes for code fragments.)</p>
