<p>Ensures that classes registered in the manifest file are instantiatable</p>

<p>Activities, services, broadcast receivers etc. registered in the manifest file must be "instantiatable" by the system, which means that the class must be public, it must have an empty public constructor, and if it's an inner class, it must be a static inner class.</p>
