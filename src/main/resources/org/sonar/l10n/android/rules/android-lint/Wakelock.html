<p>Looks for problems with <code>WakeLock</code> usage</p>

<p>Failing to release a wakelock properly can keep the Android device in a high power mode, which reduces battery life. There are several causes of this, such as releasing the wake lock in <code>onDestroy()</code> instead of in <code>onPause()</code>, failing to call <code>release()</code> in all possible code paths after an <code>acquire()</code>, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: If you are using the lock just to keep the screen on, you should strongly consider using <code>FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON</code> instead. This window flag will be correctly managed by the platform as the user moves between applications and doesn't require a special permission. See <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html#FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html#FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON</a>.</p>
