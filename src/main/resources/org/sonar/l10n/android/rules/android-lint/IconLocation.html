<p>Ensures that images are not defined in the density-independent drawable folder</p>

<p>The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to <code>drawable-mdpi</code> and consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in <code>drawable-ldpi</code>, <code>drawable-hdpi</code> and <code>drawable-xhdpi</code>. If the icon <b>really</b> is density independent (for example a solid color) you can place it in <code>drawable-nodpi</code>.</p>
