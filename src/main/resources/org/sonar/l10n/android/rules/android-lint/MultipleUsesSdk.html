<p>Checks that the <code>&lt;uses-sdk></code> element appears at most once</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;uses-sdk></code> element should appear just once; the tools will <b>not</b> merge the contents of all the elements so if you split up the attributes across multiple elements, only one of them will take effect. To fix this, just merge all the attributes from the various elements into a single &lt;uses-sdk> element.</p>
