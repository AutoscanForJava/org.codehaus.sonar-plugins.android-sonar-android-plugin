<p>Looks for Back buttons, which are not common on the Android platform.</p>

<p>According to the Android Design Guide,<br/>
<br/>
"Other platforms use an explicit back button with label to allow the user to navigate up the application's hierarchy. Instead, Android uses the main action bar's app icon for hierarchical navigation and the navigation bar's back button for temporal navigation."<br/>
This check is not very sophisticated (it just looks for buttons with the label "Back"), so it is disabled by default to not trigger on common scenarios like pairs of Back/Next buttons to paginate through screens.</p>
