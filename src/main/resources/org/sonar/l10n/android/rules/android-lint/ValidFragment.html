<p>Ensures that <code>Fragment</code> subclasses can be instantiated</p>

<p>From the Fragment documentation:<br/>
<b>Every</b> fragment must have an empty constructor, so it can be instantiated when restoring its activity's state. It is strongly recommended that subclasses do not have other constructors with parameters, since these constructors will not be called when the fragment is re-instantiated; instead, arguments can be supplied by the caller with <code>setArguments(Bundle)</code> and later retrieved by the Fragment with <code>getArguments()</code>.</p>
