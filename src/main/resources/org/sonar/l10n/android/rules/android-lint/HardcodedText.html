<p>Looks for hardcoded text attributes which should be converted to resource lookup</p>

<p>Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several reasons:<br/>
<br/>
* When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or portrait)you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when making changes)<br/>
<br/>
* The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding new translations for existing string resources.<br/>
<br/>
In Eclipse there is a quickfix to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a resource lookup.</p>
