<p>Finds icons that appear in both a <code>-nodpi</code> folder and a dpi folder</p>

<p>Bitmaps that appear in <code>drawable-nodpi</code> folders will not be scaled by the Android framework. If a drawable resource of the same name appears <b>both</b> in a <code>-nodpi</code> folder as well as a dpi folder such as <code>drawable-hdpi</code>, then the behavior is ambiguous and probably not intentional. Delete one or the other, or use different names for the icons.</p>
