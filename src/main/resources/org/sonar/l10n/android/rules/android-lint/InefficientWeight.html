<p>Looks for inefficient weight declarations in LinearLayouts</p>

<p>When only a single widget in a LinearLayout defines a weight, it is more efficient to assign a width/height of <code>0dp</code> to it since it will absorb all the remaining space anyway. With a declared width/height of <code>0dp</code> it does not have to measure its own size first.</p>
