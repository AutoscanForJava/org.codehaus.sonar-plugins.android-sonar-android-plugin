<p>Looks for usages of hyphens which can be replaced by n dash and m dash characters</p>

<p>The "n dash" (&#8211;, &amp;#8211;) and the "m dash" (&#8212;, &amp;#8212;) characters are used for ranges (n dash) and breaks (m dash). Using these instead of plain hyphens can make text easier to read and your application will look more polished.</p>
