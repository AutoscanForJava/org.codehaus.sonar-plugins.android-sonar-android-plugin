<p>Checks that launcher icons follow the recommended visual style</p>

<p>According to the Android Design Guide (<a href="http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html">http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html</a>) your launcher icons should "use a distinct silhouette", a "three-dimensional, front view, with a slight perspective as if viewed from above, so that users perceive some depth."<br/>
<br/>
The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a filled square.</p>
