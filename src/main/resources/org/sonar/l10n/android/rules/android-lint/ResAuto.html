<p>Finds resource namespaces with hardcoded package names</p>

<p>In Gradle projects, the actual package used in the final APK can vary; for you can add a <code>.debug</code> package suffix in one version and not the other. Therefore, you should <b>not</b> hardcode the application package in the resource; instead, use the special namespace <code>http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto</code> which will cause the tools to figure out the right namespace for the resource regardless of the actual package used during the build.</p>
