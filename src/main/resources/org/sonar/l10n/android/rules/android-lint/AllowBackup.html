<p>Ensure that allowBackup is explicitly set in the application's manifest</p>

<p>The allowBackup attribute determines if an application's data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup</a><br/>
<br/>
By default, this flag is set to <code>true</code>. When this flag is set to <code>true</code>, application data can be backed up and restored by the user using <code>adb backup</code> and <code>adb restore</code>.<br/>
<br/>
This may have security consequences for an application. <code>adb backup</code> allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. <code>adb restore</code> allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.<br/>
<br/>
Setting <code>allowBackup="false"</code> opts an application out of both backup and restore.<br/>
<br/>
To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set <code>android:allowBackup=(true|false)"</code></p>
