<p>Looks for TextViews which should probably allow their text to be selected</p>

This lint check looks for TextViews which are likely to be displaying data: views whose text is set dynamically. This value will be ignored on platforms older than API 11, so it is okay to set it regardless of your <code>minSdkVersion</code>.</p>
