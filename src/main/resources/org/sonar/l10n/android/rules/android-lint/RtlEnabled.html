<p>Looks for usages of right-to-left text constants without enabling RTL support</p>

<p>To enable right-to-left support, when running on API 17 and higher, you must set the <code>android:supportsRtl</code> attribute in the manifest <code>&lt;application></code> element.<br/>
If you have started adding RTL attributes, but have not yet finished the migration, you can set the attribute to false to satisfy this lint check.</p>
