<p>Ensures that all menu items supply a title</p>

<p>From the action bar documentation:<br/>
"It's important that you always define android:title for each menu item &#8212; even if you don't declare that the title appear with the action item &#8212; for three reasons:<br/>
<br/>
* If there's not enough room in the action bar for the action item, the menu item appears in the overflow menu and only the title appears.<br/>
* Screen readers for sight-impaired users read the menu item's title.<br/>
* If the action item appears with only the icon, a user can long-press the item to reveal a tool-tip that displays the action item's title.<br/>
The android:icon is always optional, but recommended.</p>
