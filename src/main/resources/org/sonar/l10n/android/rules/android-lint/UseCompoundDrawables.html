<p>Checks whether the current node can be replaced by a <code>TextView</code> using compound drawables.</p>

<p>A <code>LinearLayout</code> which contains an <code>ImageView</code> and a <code>TextView</code> can be more efficiently handled as a compound drawable (a single TextView, using the <code>drawableTop</code>, <code>drawableLeft</code>, <code>drawableRight</code> and/or <code>drawableBottom</code> attributes to draw one or more images adjacent to the text).<br/>
<br/>
If the two widgets are offset from each other with margins, this can be replaced with a <code>drawablePadding</code> attribute.<br/>
<br/>
There's a lint quickfix to perform this conversion in the Eclipse plugin.</p>
