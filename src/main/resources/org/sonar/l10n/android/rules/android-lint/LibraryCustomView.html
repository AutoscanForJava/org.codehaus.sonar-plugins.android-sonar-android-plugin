<p>Flags custom attributes in libraries, which must use the res-auto-namespace instead</p>

<p>When using a custom view with custom attributes in a library project, the layout must use the special namespace <a href="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto">http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto</a> instead of a URI which includes the library project's own package. This will be used to automatically adjust the namespace of the attributes when the library resources are merged into the application project.</p>
