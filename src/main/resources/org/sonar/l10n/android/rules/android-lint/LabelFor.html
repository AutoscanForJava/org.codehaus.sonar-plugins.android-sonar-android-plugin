<p>Ensures that text fields are marked with a <code>labelFor</code> attribute</p>

<p>Text fields should be labelled with a <code>labelFor</code> attribute, provided your <code>minSdkVersion</code> is at least 17.<br/>
<br/>
If your view is labeled but by a label in a different layout which includes this one, just suppress this warning from lint.</p>
