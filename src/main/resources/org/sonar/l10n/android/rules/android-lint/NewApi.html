<p>Finds API accesses to APIs that are not supported in all targeted API versions</p>

<p>This check scans through all the Android API calls in the application and warns about any calls that are not available on <b>all</b> versions targeted by this application (according to its minimum SDK attribute in the manifest).<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to use this API and don't need to support older devices just set the <code>minSdkVersion</code> in your <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file.<br/>
If your code is <b>deliberately</b> accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with the <code>@TargetApi</code> annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such as <code>@TargetApi(11)</code>, such that this check considers 11 rather than your manifest file's minimum SDK as the required API level.<br/>
<br/>
If you are deliberately setting <code>android:</code> attributes in style definitions, make sure you place this in a <code>values-v11</code> folder in order to avoid running into runtime conflicts on certain devices where manufacturers have added custom attributes whose ids conflict with the new ones on later platforms.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, you can use tools:targetApi="11" in an XML file to indicate that the element will only be inflated in an adequate context.</p>
