<p>Checks for missing quantity strings relevant to each locale</p>

<p>Different languages have different rules for grammatical agreement with quantity. In English, for example, the quantity 1 is a special case. We write "1 book", but for any other quantity we'd write "n books". This distinction between singular and plural is very common, but other languages make finer distinctions.<br/>
<br/>
This lint check looks at each translation of a <code>&lt;plural></code> and makes sure that all the quantity strings considered by the given language are provided by this translation.<br/>
<br/>
For example, an English translation must provide a string for <code>quantity="one"</code>. Similarly, a Czech translation must provide a string for <code>quantity="few"</code>.</p>
