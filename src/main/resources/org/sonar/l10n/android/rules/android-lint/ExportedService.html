<p>Checks for exported services that do not require permissions</p>

<p>Exported services (services which either set <code>exported=true</code> or contain an intent-filter and do not specify <code>exported=false</code>) should define a permission that an entity must have in order to launch the service or bind to it. Without this, any application can use this service.</p>
