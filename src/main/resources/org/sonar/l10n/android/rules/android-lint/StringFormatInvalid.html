<p>Checks that format strings are valid</p>

<p>If a string contains a '%' character, then the string may be a formatting string which will be passed to <code>String.format</code> from Java code to replace each '%' occurrence with specific values.<br/>
<br/>
This lint warning checks for two related problems:<br/>
(1) Formatting strings that are invalid, meaning that <code>String.format</code> will throw exceptions at runtime when attempting to use the format string.<br/>
(2) Strings containing '%' that are not formatting strings getting passed to a <code>String.format</code> call. In this case the '%' will need to be escaped as '%%'.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: Not all Strings which look like formatting strings are intended for use by <code>String.format</code>; for example, they may contain date formats intended for <code>android.text.format.Time#format()</code>. Lint cannot always figure out that a String is a date format, so you may get false warnings in those scenarios. See the suppress help topic for information on how to suppress errors in that case.</p>
