<p>Looks for @SuppressLint annotations in locations where it doesn't work for class based checks</p>

<p>The <code>@SuppressAnnotation</code> is used to suppress Lint warnings in Java files. However, while many lint checks analyzes the Java source code, where they can find annotations on (for example) local variables, some checks are analyzing the <code>.class</code> files. And in class files, annotations only appear on classes, fields and methods. Annotations placed on local variables disappear. If you attempt to suppress a lint error for a class-file based lint check, the suppress annotation not work. You must move the annotation out to the surrounding method.</p>
