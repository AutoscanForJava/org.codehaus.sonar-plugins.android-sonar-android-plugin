<p>Looks for methods treated as overrides by Dalvik</p>

<p>The Android virtual machine will treat a package private method in one class as overriding a package private method in its super class, even if they are in separate packages. This may be surprising, but for compatibility reasons the behavior has not been changed (yet).<br/>
<br/>
If you really did intend for this method to override the other, make the method <code>protected</code> instead.<br/>
<br/>
If you did <b>not</b> intend the override, consider making the method private, or changing its name or signature.</p>
