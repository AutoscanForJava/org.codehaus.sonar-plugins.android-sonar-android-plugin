<p>Checks for invalid ID definitions</p>

<p>An id definition <b>must</b> be of the form <code>@+id/yourname</code>. The tools have not rejected strings of the form <code>@+foo/bar</code> in the past, but that was an error, and could lead to tricky errors because of the way the id integers are assigned.<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to have different "scopes" for your id's, use prefixes instead, such as <code>login_button1</code> and <code>login_button2</code>.</p>
